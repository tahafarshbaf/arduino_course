# Project 03 — Potentiometer Controlled LED Brightness

## 1. What Are We Building?

In this project, we will use a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED.

As the potentiometer knob is rotated, the LED will smoothly change from completely OFF to fully ON.

This project is important because it connects:

* An **analog input** (the potentiometer)
* A **PWM output** (the LED)

It is one of the first examples of a complete sensing-and-control system using Arduino.

---

## 2. What Will You Learn?

By the end of this project you will be able to:

* Read analog sensor values using `analogRead()`
* Understand how PWM simulates analog output
* Use `analogWrite()` to control LED brightness
* Convert values from one range to another using `map()`
* Understand the relationship between input and output signals
* Build a simple closed-loop style interaction between hardware components
* Use constants and variables to write cleaner code

## 4. Key Concepts

### 4.1 Analog Input

The potentiometer produces a voltage between:

```text
0 V  → knob fully left
5 V  → knob fully right
```

Arduino measures this voltage and converts it into a number:

```text
0 V → 0
5 V → 1023
```

This conversion is performed by the built-in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

The Arduino Uno uses a 10-bit ADC:

```text
2^10 = 1024 levels
```

Resulting range:

```text
0 to 1023
```

---

### 4.2 PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

Arduino Uno cannot generate a true analog voltage on most pins.

Instead, it rapidly switches a digital pin ON and OFF.

This technique is called:

**Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**

A PWM signal is characterized by its:

* Frequency
* Duty Cycle

The duty cycle determines how bright the LED appears.

| Duty Cycle | LED Brightness |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 0%         | Off            |
| 25%        | Dim            |
| 50%        | Medium         |
| 75%        | Bright         |
| 100%       | Fully Bright   |

---

### 4.3 PWM Pins on Arduino Uno

PWM-capable pins are marked with a `~` symbol:

```text
3
5
6
9
10
11
```

For this project we will use:

```text
Pin 9
```

---

### 4.4 The map() Function

The potentiometer produces values:

```text
0 → 1023
```

But PWM expects:

```text
0 → 255
```

We therefore convert one range into another:

```cpp
map(value, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
```

Meaning:

```text
0      becomes 0
1023   becomes 255
512    becomes approximately 127
```

---

## 5. Hardware Setup

### Potentiometer Connections

| Potentiometer Pin | Arduino |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| Left              | GND     |
| Middle            | A0      |
| Right             | 5V      |

### LED Connections

| LED Terminal | Connection           |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| Anode (+)    | Pin 9                |
| Cathode (-)  | 220 Ω resistor → GND |

---

## 6. The Code

### Version 1 — Basic

```cpp
void setup() {
}

void loop() {

  int value = analogRead(A0);

  int brightness = map(value, 0, 1023, 0, 255);

  analogWrite(9, brightness);
}
```

---


---

### Version 2 — Best

```cpp
const int POT_PIN = A0;
const int LED_PIN = 9;

void setup() {

  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);

  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {

  int potValue = analogRead(POT_PIN);

  int brightness = map(potValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);

  analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness);

  Serial.print("Potentiometer: ");
  Serial.print(potValue);

  Serial.print("    Brightness: ");
  Serial.println(brightness);

  delay(20);
}
```

## 8. Expected Behavior

| Potentiometer Position | ADC Value | PWM Value | LED                |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Fully Left             | 0         | 0         | Off                |
| 25%                    | ~256      | ~64       | Dim                |
| 50%                    | ~512      | ~127      | Medium             |
| 75%                    | ~768      | ~191      | Bright             |
| Fully Right            | 1023      | 255       | Maximum Brightness |

Many real systems work exactly the same way:

* Temperature controller
* Motor speed controller
* Robotic joints
* Industrial automation systems
* Flight control systems

The only difference is the complexity of the sensor and actuator.

## 8.5 The Trick: Smoothing a Noisy Reading

Plug a real potentiometer into a real breadboard and watch its raw
`analogRead()` values on the Serial Monitor — even holding the knob
perfectly still, you'll see it jitter by a few counts (`512`, `514`,
`511`, `513`...). This comes from electrical noise on the wiring and
from the ADC itself. On an LED it's invisible, but the moment you use
that value for something precise — like a displayed number, or the
speed limit in Lecture 09 — the jitter becomes an annoying flicker.

The fix is a **moving average**: keep the last few readings and use their
average instead of any single one.

```cpp
const int NUM_READINGS = 10;
int readings[NUM_READINGS];   // circular buffer of past readings
int readIndex = 0;
int total = 0;                // running sum of the buffer

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_READINGS; i++) {
    readings[i] = 0;
  }
}

int smoothedRead(int pin) {
  total -= readings[readIndex];          // remove the oldest reading from the sum
  readings[readIndex] = analogRead(pin); // take a new reading
  total += readings[readIndex];          // add it to the sum
  readIndex = (readIndex + 1) % NUM_READINGS;  // move to the next slot, wrapping around

  return total / NUM_READINGS;           // the average
}
```

Every call to `smoothedRead()` replaces the oldest of the last 10 readings
with a fresh one and returns the average of all 10 — so the result follows
real changes (turning the knob) but ignores single noisy spikes. This
exact circular-buffer pattern reappears in Exercise 2 of Lecture 09
(Speed Measurement) for averaging speed readings.

*Trade-off: a bigger `NUM_READINGS` gives a smoother value but reacts more
slowly to real changes — there's no free lunch, only a dial to tune.*

## 9. Exercises & Challenges

### Exercise 1 — Reverse Control ⭐⭐

Modify the program so that:

```text
Knob Left  → Bright LED
Knob Right → Dim LED
```



---

### Exercise 2 — Serial Monitor Analyzer ⭐⭐

Print:

* ADC value
* PWM value
* Percentage of brightness

Example:

```text
ADC: 512
PWM: 127
Brightness: 50%
```

---

### Exercise 3 — Dual LED Controller ⭐⭐⭐

Add a second LED.

Requirements:

* LED1 gets brighter as the knob turns right.
* LED2 gets dimmer as the knob turns right.

This creates an inverse relationship between the two LEDs.

---

### Exercise 4 — Software Dimmer ⭐⭐⭐

Remove the potentiometer completely.

Use a variable and gradually increase and decrease the LED brightness automatically.

Create a smooth fading effect.

```

The famous Arduino "Fade" example uses the same PWM principle.
```
---
### Exercise 5 — LED Bar Graph ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Create a simple LED level indicator using four LEDs.

#### Components Needed

| Quantity | Component |
|----------|-----------|
| 4 | LEDs |
| 4 | 220 Ω Resistors |

#### Connections

| LED | Arduino Pin |
|------|-------------|
| LED 1 | 8 |
| LED 2 | 9 |
| LED 3 | 10 |
| LED 4 | 11 |

#### Goal

The potentiometer value should determine how many LEDs are ON.

| Potentiometer Value | LEDs ON |
|---------------------|----------|
| 0 – 255 | LED1 |
| 256 – 511 | LED1 + LED2 |
| 512 – 767 | LED1 + LED2 + LED3 |
| 768 – 1023 | LED1 + LED2 + LED3 + LED4 |

his principle is commonly used in:

- Battery charge indicators
- Audio level meters
- Fuel level indicators
- Industrial monitoring panels
- Power bank charge displays

**َAnswer**:
```C++
int led[] = {8,9,10,11};
int brightness = 0;    

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); 
  
  for(int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
  pinMode(led[i], OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  int value = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.print("Pot value: ");
  Serial.print(value);
  Serial.print("\n");
  
  for(int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
  digitalWrite(led[i], LOW);

  int level = (value / 256);  // output = {0,1,2,3}

  for (int i = 0; i <= level; i++)
  digitalWrite(led[i], HIGH);

  delay(500);
}
```
پ
## Potentiometer Speed Calculation

```C++
const int potPin = A0;

int currentPosition = 0;
int previousPosition = 0;

unsigned long currentTime =0 ;
unsigned long previousTime = 0;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);

  previousTime = millis(); 
  previousPosition = analogRead(A0);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  currentTime = millis(); 

  if(currentTime - previousTime >= 100)
  {
    currentPosition = analogRead(A0);
    float dt = (currentTime - previousTime) / 1000.0;
    float speed = (currentPosition - previousPosition) / dt;

    Serial.print("Position: ");
    Serial.print(currentPosition);

    Serial.print("\tSpeed:");
    Serial.println(speed);

    previousTime = currentTime;
    previousPosition = currentPosition;

  }

}
```
